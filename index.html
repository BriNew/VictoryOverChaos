          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s">
            <h3>Do I need to be present during the clean out?</h3>
            <p>No one knows your home better than you. By tackling this step together, we can separate what serves your life and gives it meaning from what stands in your way.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s">
            <h3>What happens to my stuff?</h3>
            <p>The items that matter to you will be beautifully organized and optimized within the flow of your life. The items you don't need will be donated to charity (we'll even handle the drop off).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s">
            <h3>Do you help with moving?</h3>
            <p>The most important part of a successful move is successful preparation. We love to help clients declutter and organize prior to the move, and are happy to organize your new space when you get there.</p>
          </div>   
          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s">
            <h3>Do you have a design style?</h3>
            <p>Of course—yours! I believe your home should be the best-possible reflection of who you are and what you love. That's why we involve you in the process, rather than taking over.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s test2">
            <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
            <p>We charge $100/hr. and book sessions in either 4- or 8-hour blocks. Our experience tells us that at least a half-day session is necessary to make meaningful progress. But if you have questions, feel free to ask. </p>
          </div> 
          <div class="quote-item p_r_s p_l_s">
            <h3>Is an organized home hard to maintain?</h3>
            <p>Not if it's organized well! That's why we take extra care to remove the items that no longer serve your life, and to make sure every item you do use has a space. When we're done, you'll have what you need, when and where you need it, so you can get on with life.</p>
